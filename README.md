# HouseMatch

A swipe-to-vote music curation platform built for college house music fans.

---

## Overview

HouseMatch solves a specific problem: house music fans have no centralized, democratic tool for ranking tracks. Spotify and SoundCloud are algorithmic and passive. HouseMatch puts curation in the hands of the community through a swipe-to-vote mechanic that surfaces the best tracks to the top.

The platform supports two user roles. Members browse the feed, vote on songs, and track the leaderboard. Admins do all of that plus submit songs, delete songs, and manage the catalog through a dedicated dashboard. No audio files are stored. All playback is handled via SoundCloud embeds, keeping the platform copyright-clean.
